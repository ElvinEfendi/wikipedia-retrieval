Parsing and indexing Wikipedia articles
===================

This is one of my courseworks I've done during my study.
The program consists of four main modules:
 - Indexer: this module handles indexing documents
 - Parser: this module parses the XML data file creates documents(Page object) and send it to Indexer for indexing
 - Searcher: this module handles searching
 - WikipediaRetriever: this is a wrapper module for all functionalities. You should run this module if you want to use provided functionalities of the program. After running this module you will have 2 options: first one is indexing the data and the second option is to query in already created index.
